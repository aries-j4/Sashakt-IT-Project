## üöÄ Features
1.	Read & Compose Blogs-: Anything can be found provided one looks at the right place. With this idea in mind, we designed the feature of writing small blogs where different people can tell how they managed to cope with their difficulties and stress for others to read and get inspired. 
2.	Send SMS Seeking Help-: This is basically a system where a user can send an sms to our team (after entering their credentials) and file a complaint without letting anyone know. This has been done using sms sending APIs of Vonage (using free credits).
3.	Twitter Tweet Analysis-: The user can enter any trending hashtag and the website offers an analysis in the form of wordcloud and pie charts. This involves the use of Machine Learning.
4.	Resource Pages-: We have added resource pages in our project that includes information/videos on self-defense and a small quiz on women safety.

- [ ] Adding blog recommendations based on likes and topics.
- [ ] Segregation of the SMS messages received based on complaint-category.
- [ ] Adding an emergency SOS feature to all the contacts entered by the user.
- [ ] Sentiment Analysis of text entered by users along with tweet analysis.


<a id="conclusion"></a>
## üí° Conclusion
With the project Sashakt, we aimed to create a website that serves as an assistant and offers features of filing complaints, reading blogs and becoming aware of social media atrocities. 

Towards the end of the project, we were able to write working code for all the above mentioned features. The user can login or register, add contacts, write their own blogs, send sms to a number filing any complaint and see the analysis of twitter tweets by entering any trending hashtag. 

We were able to learn various aspects of coding through this project. We worked with python, flask, html, css, bootstrap, Javascript, sqlite, Machine Learning, APIs etc using Visual Studio Code, git and gitHub.
